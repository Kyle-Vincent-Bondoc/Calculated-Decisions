# Calculated Decisions

**Calculated Decisions** is a web-based puzzle calculator game where players complete “mathematical orders” given by the King of Constants, Pi. Using only a calculator and a book of operations, players must create equations to reach a target number with a limited set of operations.

---

## Objective
Form an equation that equals the **target number** using **1–4 operations** from the allowed set. Successfully solving the equation rewards you “1 n” from Pi, the king of constants.

---

## Features
- **Two-screen interface:**
  - **Top screen:** Displays the target number and allowed operations.
  - **Bottom screen:** Displays your current equation.
- **Interactive buttons:** Clickable buttons for digits and operations.
- **Operations supported:**
  - `+` Addition
  - `-` Subtraction
  - `*` Multiplication
  - `/` Division
  - `**` Exponentiation (requires another operation)
  - `%` Modulus (requires another equation)
  - `!` Factorial
  - `sum` Summation (n + n-1 + ... + 1)
- **Story/Lore:** Complete Mathematical Orders by the constants and get rewarded by Pi.
- **Operation guide:** Click the "Operations" button to see the meaning of each operation.
- **Validation:** Checks if your equation equals the target number.

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Read the target number and allowed operations in the top screen.
3. Enter your equation using the buttons or your keyboard.
4. Press `=` to check your answer.
5. If correct, you get rewarded; if incorrect, try again.
6. Click the "Operations" button anytime to review the meaning of each operation.
